Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `mariadb` for local development.

 1. Fork the `mariadb` repo on GitHub.
 2. Clone your fork locally:

     <!-- language: lang-bash -->

            $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/mariadb.git

 3. Create a branch for local development:

     <!-- language: lang-bash -->

            $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

     Now you can make your changes locally.

 4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

     <!-- language: lang-bash -->

            $ git add .
            $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
            $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

 5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for latest Docker Engine/Docker Compose oficial versions.
